WHERE A LIMITATION OF LIABILITY IS NOT ALLOWED IN FULL OR IN PART, THIS LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.\nThe disclaimer of warranties and limitation of liability provided above shall be interpreted in a manner that, to the extent possible, most closely approximates an absolute disclaimer and waiver of all liability.\n\nSection 6 – Term and Termination.\n\nThis Public License applies for the term of the Copyright and Similar Rights licensed here. However, if You fail to comply with this Public License, then Your rights under this Public License terminate automatically.\nWhere Your right to use the Licensed Material has terminated under Section 6(a), it reinstates:\n\nautomatically as of the date the violation is cured, provided it is cured within 30 days of Your discovery of the violation; or\nupon express reinstatement by the Licensor.\n\nFor the avoidance of doubt, this Section 6(b) does not affect any right the Licensor may have to seek remedies for Your violations of this Public License.\nFor the avoidance of doubt, the Licensor may also offer the Licensed Material under separate terms or conditions or stop distributing the Licensed Material at any time; however, doing so will not terminate this Public License.\nSections 1, 5, 6, 7, and 8 survive termination of this Public License.\n\nSection 7 – Other Terms and Conditions.\n\nThe Licensor shall not be bound by any additional or different terms or conditions communicated by You unless expressly agreed.\nAny arrangements, understandings, or agreements regarding the Licensed Material not stated herein are separate from and independent of the terms and conditions of this Public License.\n\nSection 8 – Interpretation.\n\nFor the avoidance of doubt, this Public License does not, and shall not be interpreted to, reduce, limit, restrict, or impose conditions on any use of the Licensed Material that could lawfully be made without permission under this Public License.\nTo the extent possible, if any provision of this Public License is deemed unenforceable, it shall be automatically reformed to the minimum extent necessary to make it enforceable. If the provision cannot be reformed, it shall be severed from this Public License without affecting the enforceability of the remaining terms and conditions.\nNo term or condition of this Public License will be waived and no failure to comply consented to unless expressly agreed to by the Licensor.\nNothing in this Public License constitutes or may be interpreted as a limitation upon, or waiver of, any privileges and immunities that apply to the Licensor or You, including from the legal processes of any jurisdiction or authority.\n\n=======================================================================\nCreative Commons is not a party to its public licenses.

    "text": "The main Zotero application comes pre-loaded with several popular citation styles like APA, Chicago, Nature, and Vancouver style. These formats are generally sufficient for most users and scenarios, but, in the event that you need a style that is not included, you can easily add more.\nThe styles are written in the Citation Style Language (CSL), a format that is easily modifiable and can be used with other citation management software. Zotero maintains a collection of over 8,000 additional citation styles on the Zotero Style Repository. There are two ways to add a new citation style to Zotero:\n\nThe CSL files can be downloaded directly from the Zotero Style Repository. Once you have the file, you can add it to Zotero by dragging and dropping it into the Zotero application, or by attempting to open the file. This should open a prompt asking if you’d like to install the style.\nFrom within the Zotero application. The directions for this will vary based on your operating system. In general, you can find the option to add a new citation style in the preferences or settings menu where the other citation styles are listed. You may find a button that says “Get additional styles” or “Add style.” Clicking this button will open a window where you can search for and install new styles. (This window, however, is essentially a browser window that opens the Zotero Style Repository.)\n\nOnce you have added a new citation style, it will be available in the Zotero application for you to select when you are creating a bibliography. If you are using Zotero with a word processor, you may need to restart the word processor to see the new style.\n\n\n\n Back to top",

    "text": "The first step to using Zotero is adding references to your library. You can add references to Zotero in several ways:\n\nSave to Zotero with the Zotero Connector browser extension\nManual entry\nImport from online databases.\nImport from other software.\n\nThe most common and preferred way of entering references is by using the Zotero Connector browser extension. The Zotero Connector allows you to save references directly from your browser to your Zotero library. The connector will, when possible, download a PDF of the article and attach it to the reference. If you save content from a webpage that does not have an available PDF download of the content, the Connector will take a snapshot of the webpage to preserve the information in case the page is later changed or removed.\nThe Zotero Connector is not perfect, however, and you may occassionally need to “manually” enter a reference. To do this, click on the “New Item” button in Zotero, and select the type of reference you want to add. You can then enter the metadata for the reference manually. However, if you can find a BibTex or RIS file for the reference, you can import the reference into Zotero by dragging and dropping the file into the Zotero window, or by copying the BibTex content and then selecting File -&gt; Import from Clipboard in Zotero.\nLess commonly, you may need to import references from other software. To do this, export the references from the software in a compatible format, and import them into Zotero. Zotero can import references from a variety of formats, including BibTex, RIS, and EndNote XML.",
