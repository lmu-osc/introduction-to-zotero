    "text": "Manual Entries\nThe Zotero Connector is not perfect, however, and you may occasionally need to “manually” enter a reference. To do this, click on the “New Item” button in Zotero, and select the type of reference you want to add. You can then enter the metadata for the reference manually. This is a more time-consuming process than using the Zotero Connector, but it is necessary if you cannot find the reference online (e.g. a book or a conference presentation).\nHowever, if you can find a BibTex or RIS file for the reference, you can import the reference into Zotero by dragging and dropping the file into the Zotero window, or by copying the BibTex content and then selecting File -&gt; Import from Clipboard in Zotero.\nThe example below will demonstrate how to manually import a BibTex entry.\n\n1. Locate Source2. Open Citation3. Copy BibTex4. Import to Zotero5. Check Library\n\n\n\n\n\nIdentify the object you want to cite. If you can find the publication on Google Scholar, for example, BibTex entries are readily available.

Note how much less information is included by importing BibTex, however. Compared to the Zotero Connector, we are, at minimum, missing a PDF copy of the document and the date on which we accessed the material.\n\n\n\n\n\nLess commonly, you may need to import references from other software. To do this, export the references from the software in a compatible format, and import them into Zotero. Zotero can import references from a variety of formats, including BibTex, RIS, and EndNote XML.",

You will generally not need to make or edit BibTex files if you are using a word processor with a Zotero plugin, as the plugin will automatically generate the bibliography for you. However, if you are using a text editor that does not have a Zotero plugin, you can export a BibTex file from Zotero to generate a bibliography.\nTo do this, right-click on the folder or publication of interest, and select the option to “Export Collection.” You can then choose the BibTex format, and save the file to your computer. You can then include this BibTex file in your document to generate a bibliography.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBibTex Tip\n\n\n\nAll you really need to know about BibTex is that it is a structured file format for bibliographies, and Quarto documents should have a .bib file in the same directory as the .qmd file plus a reference to the .bib file in the YAML header. This will be discussed in the Citations in Quarto chapter.",

    "text": "Creative Commons Corporation (“Creative Commons”) is not a law firm and does not provide legal services or legal advice. Distribution of Creative Commons public licenses does not create a lawyer-client or other relationship. Creative Commons makes its licenses and related information available on an “as-is” basis. Creative Commons gives no warranties regarding its licenses, any material licensed under their terms and conditions, or any related information. Creative Commons disclaims all liability for damages resulting from their use to the fullest extent possible.\nUsing Creative Commons Public Licenses\nCreative Commons public licenses provide a standard set of terms and conditions that creators and other rights holders may use to share original works of authorship and other material subject to copyright and certain other rights specified in the public license below. The following considerations are for informational purposes only, are not exhaustive, and do not form part of our licenses.\n\nConsiderations for licensors: Our public licenses are intended for use by those authorized to give the public permission to use material in ways otherwise restricted by copyright and certain other rights. Our licenses are irrevocable. Licensors should read and understand the terms and conditions of the license they choose before applying it. Licensors should also secure all rights necessary before applying our licenses so that the public can reuse the material as expected. Licensors should clearly mark any material not subject to the license. This includes other CC-licensed material, or material used under an exception or limitation to copyright. More considerations for licensors.\nConsiderations for the public: By using one of our public licenses, a licensor grants the public permission to use the licensed material under specified terms and conditions. If the licensor’s permission is not necessary for any reason–for example, because of any applicable exception or limitation to copyright–then that use is not regulated by the license. Our licenses grant only permissions under copyright and certain other rights that a licensor has authority to grant. Use of the licensed material may still be restricted for other reasons, including because others have copyright or other rights in the material. A licensor may make special requests, such as asking that all changes be marked or described. Although not required by our licenses, you are encouraged to respect those requests where reasonable. More considerations for the public.\n\n\n\nBy exercising the Licensed Rights (defined below), You accept and agree to be bound by the terms and conditions of this Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 4.0 International Public License (“Public License”). To the extent this Public License may be interpreted as a contract, You are granted the Licensed Rights in consideration of Your acceptance of these terms and conditions, and the Licensor grants You such rights in consideration of benefits the Licensor receives from making the Licensed Material available under these terms and conditions.\n\n\n\nAdapted Material means material subject to Copyright and Similar Rights that is derived from or based upon the Licensed Material and in which the Licensed Material is translated, altered, arranged, transformed, or otherwise modified in a manner requiring permission under the Copyright and Similar Rights held by the Licensor. For purposes of this Public License, where the Licensed Material is a musical work, performance, or sound recording, Adapted Material is always produced where the Licensed Material is synched in timed relation with a moving image.\nAdapter’s License means the license You apply to Your Copyright and Similar Rights in Your contributions to Adapted Material in accordance with the terms and conditions of this Public License.\nBY-SA Compatible License means a license listed at creativecommons.org/compatiblelicenses, approved by Creative Commons as essentially the equivalent of this Public License.\nCopyright and Similar Rights means copyright and/or similar rights closely related to copyright including, without limitation, performance, broadcast, sound recording, and Sui Generis Database Rights, without regard to how the rights are labeled or categorized. For purposes of this Public License, the rights specified in Section 2(b)(1)-(2) are not Copyright and Similar Rights.\nEffective Technological Measures means those measures that, in the absence of proper authority, may not be circumvented under laws fulfilling obligations under Article 11 of the WIPO Copyright Treaty adopted on December 20, 1996, and/or similar international agreements.\nExceptions and Limitations means fair use, fair dealing, and/or any other exception or limitation to Copyright and Similar Rights that applies to Your use of the Licensed Material.\nLicense Elements means the license attributes listed in the name of a Creative Commons Public License. The License Elements of this Public License are Attribution and ShareAlike.\nLicensed Material means the artistic or literary work, database, or other material to which the Licensor applied this Public License.\nLicensed Rights means the rights granted to You subject to the terms and conditions of this Public License, which are limited to all Copyright and Similar Rights that apply to Your use of the Licensed Material and that the Licensor has authority to license.\nLicensor means the individual(s) or entity(ies) granting rights under this Public License.\nShare means to provide material to the public by any means or process that requires permission under the Licensed Rights, such as reproduction, public display, public performance, distribution, dissemination, communication, or importation, and to make material available to the public including in ways that members of the public may access the material from a place and at a time individually chosen by them.\nSui Generis Database Rights means rights other than copyright resulting from Directive 96/9/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 11 March 1996 on the legal protection of databases, as amended and/or succeeded, as well as other essentially equivalent rights anywhere in the world.\nYou means the individual or entity exercising the Licensed Rights under this Public License. Your has a corresponding meaning.\n\n\n\n\n\nLicense grant.\n\nSubject to the terms and conditions of this Public License, the Licensor hereby grants You a worldwide, royalty-free, non-sublicensable, non-exclusive, irrevocable license to exercise the Licensed Rights in the Licensed Material to:\nA. reproduce and Share the Licensed Material, in whole or in part; and\nB. produce, reproduce, and Share Adapted Material.\nExceptions and Limitations. For the avoidance of doubt, where Exceptions and Limitations apply to Your use, this Public License does not apply, and You do not need to comply with its terms and conditions.\nTerm. The term of this Public License is specified in Section 6(a).\nMedia and formats; technical modifications allowed. The Licensor authorizes You to exercise the Licensed Rights in all media and formats whether now known or hereafter created, and to make technical modifications necessary to do so. The Licensor waives and/or agrees not to assert any right or authority to forbid You from making technical modifications necessary to exercise the Licensed Rights, including technical modifications necessary to circumvent Effective Technological Measures. For purposes of this Public License, simply making modifications authorized by this Section 2(a)(4) never produces Adapted Material.\nDownstream recipients.\nA. Offer from the Licensor – Licensed Material. Every recipient of the Licensed Material automatically receives an offer from the Licensor to exercise the Licensed Rights under the terms and conditions of this Public License.\nB. Additional offer from the Licensor – Adapted Material. Every recipient of Adapted Material from You automatically receives an offer from the Licensor to exercise the Licensed Rights in the Adapted Material under the conditions of the Adapter’s License You apply.\nC. No downstream restrictions. You may not offer or impose any additional or different terms or conditions on, or apply any Effective Technological Measures to, the Licensed Material if doing so restricts exercise of the Licensed Rights by any recipient of the Licensed Material.\nNo endorsement. Nothing in this Public License constitutes or may be construed as permission to assert or imply that You are, or that Your use of the Licensed Material is, connected with, or sponsored, endorsed, or granted official status by, the Licensor or others designated to receive attribution as provided in Section 3(a)(1)(A)(i).\n\nOther rights.\n\nMoral rights, such as the right of integrity, are not licensed under this Public License, nor are publicity, privacy, and/or other similar personality rights; however, to the extent possible, the Licensor waives and/or agrees not to assert any such rights held by the Licensor to the limited extent necessary to allow You to exercise the Licensed Rights, but not otherwise.\nPatent and trademark rights are not licensed under this Public License.\nTo the extent possible, the Licensor waives any right to collect royalties from You for the exercise of the Licensed Rights, whether directly or through a collecting society under any voluntary or waivable statutory or compulsory licensing scheme. In all other cases the Licensor expressly reserves any right to collect such royalties.\n\n\n\n\n\nYour exercise of the Licensed Rights is expressly made subject to the following conditions.\n\nAttribution.\n\nIf You Share the Licensed Material (including in modified form), You must:\nA. retain the following if it is supplied by the Licensor with the Licensed Material:\n\nidentification of the creator(s) of the Licensed Material and any others designated to receive attribution, in any reasonable manner requested by the Licensor (including by pseudonym if designated);\na copyright notice;\na notice that refers to this Public License;\na notice that refers to the disclaimer of warranties;\na URI or hyperlink to the Licensed Material to the extent reasonably practicable;\n\nB. indicate if You modified the Licensed Material and retain an indication of any previous modifications; and\nC. indicate the Licensed Material is licensed under this Public License, and include the text of, or the URI or hyperlink to, this Public License.\nYou may satisfy the conditions in Section 3(a)(1) in any reasonable manner based on the medium, means, and context in which You Share the Licensed Material. For example, it may be reasonable to satisfy the conditions by providing a URI or hyperlink to a resource that includes the required information.\nIf requested by the Licensor, You must remove any of the information required by Section 3(a)(1)(A) to the extent reasonably practicable.\n\nShareAlike.\n\nIn addition to the conditions in Section 3(a), if You Share Adapted Material You produce, the following conditions also apply.\n\nThe Adapter’s License You apply must be a Creative Commons license with the same License Elements, this version or later, or a BY-SA Compatible License.\nYou must include the text of, or the URI or hyperlink to, the Adapter’s License You apply. You may satisfy this condition in any reasonable manner based on the medium, means, and context in which You Share Adapted Material.\nYou may not offer or impose any additional or different terms or conditions on, or apply any Effective Technological Measures to, Adapted Material that restrict exercise of the rights granted under the Adapter’s License You apply.\n\n\n\n\nWhere the Licensed Rights include Sui Generis Database Rights that apply to Your use of the Licensed Material:\n\nfor the avoidance of doubt, Section 2(a)(1) grants You the right to extract, reuse, reproduce, and Share all or a substantial portion of the contents of the database;\nif You include all or a substantial portion of the database contents in a database in which You have Sui Generis Database Rights, then the database in which You have Sui Generis Database Rights (but not its individual contents) is Adapted Material, including for purposes of Section 3(b); and\nYou must comply with the conditions in Section 3(a) if You Share all or a substantial portion of the contents of the database.\n\nFor the avoidance of doubt, this Section 4 supplements and does not replace Your obligations under this Public License where the Licensed Rights include other Copyright and Similar Rights.\n\n\n\n\nUnless otherwise separately undertaken by the Licensor, to the extent possible, the Licensor offers the Licensed Material as-is and as-available, and makes no representations or warranties of any kind concerning the Licensed Material, whether express, implied, statutory, or other. This includes, without limitation, warranties of title, merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, non-infringement, absence of latent or other defects, accuracy, or the presence or absence of errors, whether or not known or discoverable. Where disclaimers of warranties are not allowed in full or in part, this disclaimer may not apply to You.\nTo the extent possible, in no event will the Licensor be liable to You on any legal theory (including, without limitation, negligence) or otherwise for any direct, special, indirect, incidental, consequential, punitive, exemplary, or other losses, costs, expenses, or damages arising out of this Public License or use of the Licensed Material, even if the Licensor has been advised of the possibility of such losses, costs, expenses, or damages. Where a limitation of liability is not allowed in full or in part, this limitation may not apply to You.\nThe disclaimer of warranties and limitation of liability provided above shall be interpreted in a manner that, to the extent possible, most closely approximates an absolute disclaimer and waiver of all liability.\n\n\n\n\n\nThis Public License applies for the term of the Copyright and Similar Rights licensed here. However, if You fail to comply with this Public License, then Your rights under this Public License terminate automatically.\nWhere Your right to use the Licensed Material has terminated under Section 6(a), it reinstates:\n\nautomatically as of the date the violation is cured, provided it is cured within 30 days of Your discovery of the violation; or\nupon express reinstatement by the Licensor.\n\nFor the avoidance of doubt, this Section 6(b) does not affect any right the Licensor may have to seek remedies for Your violations of this Public License.\nFor the avoidance of doubt, the Licensor may also offer the Licensed Material under separate terms or conditions or stop distributing the Licensed Material at any time; however, doing so will not terminate this Public License.\nSections 1, 5, 6, 7, and 8 survive termination of this Public License.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Licensor shall not be bound by any additional or different terms or conditions communicated by You unless expressly agreed.\nAny arrangements, understandings, or agreements regarding the Licensed Material not stated herein are separate from and independent of the terms and conditions of this Public License.\n\n\n\n\n\nFor the avoidance of doubt, this Public License does not, and shall not be interpreted to, reduce, limit, restrict, or impose conditions on any use of the Licensed Material that could lawfully be made without permission under this Public License.\nTo the extent possible, if any provision of this Public License is deemed unenforceable, it shall be automatically reformed to the minimum extent necessary to make it enforceable. If the provision cannot be reformed, it shall be severed from this Public License without affecting the enforceability of the remaining terms and conditions.\nNo term or condition of this Public License will be waived and no failure to comply consented to unless expressly agreed to by the Licensor.\nNothing in this Public License constitutes or may be interpreted as a limitation upon, or waiver of, any privileges and immunities that apply to the Licensor or You, including from the legal processes of any jurisdiction or authority.\n\n\nCreative Commons is not a party to its public licenses. Notwithstanding, Creative Commons may elect to apply one of its public licenses to material it publishes and in those instances will be considered the “Licensor.” The text of the Creative Commons public licenses is dedicated to the public domain under the CC0 Public Domain Dedication.

    "text": "What are references.bib Files?\nA references.bib file is a BibTeX file that contains all of the references you want to cite in your document. This file is used to generate the bibliography at the end of your document, and it is necessary to include this file in your project directory in order to insert citations. You can create this file manually, but it is generally easier to export your references from a citation manager or allow RStudio to manage the creation of the file for you.\nWhen using a references.bib file with a Quarto document, you must specify the name of the file in the YAML header of your document like this:\n---\ntitle: \"Your project title\"\nbibliography: references.bib\n---\nNote that you can name the file something other than references.bib, but you must ensure that the name of the file you specify in the YAML header matches the name of the file you have saved in your project directory.\nYou will rarely need to edit the references.bib file directly, but you can open it in a text editor to see the structure of the file. An example of an entry inside of a references.bib file might look like this:\n@article{horst2022,\n    title = {Palmer Archipelago Penguins Data in the palmerpenguins R Package - An Alternative to Anderson's Irises},\n    author = {Horst, Allison M. and Hill, Alison Presmanes and Gorman, Kristen B.},\n    year = {2022},\n    month = {06},\n    date = {2022-06-21},\n    journal = {The R Journal},\n    pages = {244--254},\n    volume = {14},\n    number = {1},\n    doi = {10.32614/RJ-2022-020},\n    url = {https://doi.org/10.32614/RJ-2022-020/}\n}",

    "text": "What is a Citation Key?\nCitation keys are unique identifiers for each reference in your bibliography. They are used to insert citations in your document and are typically generated automatically by your text editor. These keys are necessary because they connect your citations to the correct entry in the references.bib file.\nExtending the references.bib example, you would cite the Palmer Penguins data set from 2022 by Allison Horst with the citation key @horst2022. You would use this citation key in your document to insert a citation to this reference.\nRStudio generates a citation key for each new item you include in a document, and they typically follow the format @authorYear or @authorYearLetter when there are multiple references matching the format. 1 These keys can be customized to your liking, but this should be done only prior to using them the first time.2",

    "text": "Referencing by Citation Key\nWhen you insert a citation in your document, you will use the citation key of the reference you want to cite.\nIf you export a library from Zotero, however, a different default method for generating the citation keys will be used. These differences will be discussed in the following sub-sections, RStudio Visual Editor and Manual Entry.\nYou can insert a citation in your document by using the @ symbol followed by the citation key of the reference you want to cite. For example, I have saved the Zotero Quick Start guide to my Zotero library for this tutorial, and in order to to cite this guide, I would use the citation key [@zotero] in my document. The text would look like this:\n\n“Items can be assigned tags. Tags are named by the user. An item can be assigned as many tags as is needed.”[@zotero]\n\nThis will insert a citation that is displayed in your document like this:\n\n“Items can be assigned tags. Tags are named by the user. An item can be assigned as many tags as is needed.”(Zotero, n.d.)\n\nNote that the citation key can be inserted in two ways: with or without brackets [], which yield formatting differences. A citation without brackets, @zotero, will appear inline as “Zotero (n.d.)”, while a citation with brackets, [@zotero], will appear as “(Zotero, n.d.)”.",

Once you have found the reference you want to cite, you can click on it to insert the citation into your document.\nNote that this process is simply a “visual” short code for inserting the citation key into your document, but is more convenient as it lets you interactively search through your Zotero library and dynamically add citations to your references.bib file.\n\n1.

Open the Zotero folder relevant to your project, the “Zotero Tutorial” in this example.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPress once on the citation you would like to insert. Note taht the citation will be highlighted, and there is now a short tag in the bottom left. This is the citation key that will be used by default.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you’d like to edit the key to something more memorable or informative, press on the pencil button and edit away. In this example, the citation key has been changed to @zotero-guide.  Note that citation key changes must be done the first time you include a new citation and you cannot have spaces in the name. Press Insert when done.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYour citation is now included inline in the document. Moreover, the bibliography is now connected to your Quarto document with the addition of the bibliography: references.bib text to the yaml header.

You can change the citation style of your document by adding the csl: &lt;your-csl-file.csl&gt; line to the YAML header like below:\n---\ntitle: \"My Document\"\nbibliography: references.bib\ncsl: your-csl-file.csl\n---\nThis will change the citation style of your document to the style specified in the CSL file you provide. You can find CSL files for different citation styles on the Citation Styles Library website.\nNote that the csl: field can also be a link directly to a CSL file online. For example, the following YAML header will use the Nature citation style:\n---\ntitle: \"My Document\"\nbibliography: references.bib\ncsl: https://www.zotero.org/styles/nature\n---",

    "text": "A Note on Updating Citations in Zotero\nA current shortcoming with inserting citations into Quarto documents is that the bibliography does not automatically update when you update the references in Zotero.\nThat is, if you make changes to the citations within Zotero, you may need to delete the references.bib file and reinsert the citations to force update the bibliography in your project. This sounds a bit complicated, but simply deleting the references.bib file and reinserting a single citation will prompt RStudio to regenerate the references.bib file with the updated references.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAutomatic Updates in the Future?\n\n\n\nAn issue requesting that the bibliography automatically update when references are updated in Zotero was previosuly opened in the RStudio GitHub repository, but it was closed without being addressed. you can find the issue here. you can, however, comment that you’d like to see this feature implemented in the future ;).",
