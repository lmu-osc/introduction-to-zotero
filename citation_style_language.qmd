# CSL and Zotero

The main Zotero application comes pre-loaded with several popular citation styles like APA, Chicago, Nature, and Vancouver style. These formats are generally sufficient for most users and scenarios, but, in the event that you need a style that is not included, you can easily add more. 

The styles are written in the Citation Style Language (CSL), a format that is easily modifiable and can be used with other citation management software. Zotero maintains a collection of over 8,000 additional citation styles on the [Zotero Style Repository](https://www.zotero.org/styles). There are two ways to add a new citation style to Zotero:

1. The CSL files can be downloaded directly from the Zotero Style Repository. Once you have the file, you can add it to Zotero by dragging and dropping it into the Zotero application, or by attempting to open the file. This should open a prompt asking if you'd like to install the style.
2. From within the Zotero application. The directions for this will vary based on your operating system. In general, you can find the option to add a new citation style in the preferences or settings menu where the other citation styles are listed. You may find a button that says "Get additional styles" or "Add style." Clicking this button will open a window where you can search for and install new styles. (This window, however, is essentially a browser window that opens the Zotero Style Repository.)

Once you have added a new citation style, it will be available in the Zotero application for you to select when you are creating a bibliography. If you are using Zotero with a word processor, you may need to restart the word processor to see the new style.
