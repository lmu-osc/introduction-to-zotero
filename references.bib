	abstract = {In 1935, Edgar Anderson collected size measurements for 150 flowers from three species of Iris on the Gaspé Peninsula in Quebec, Canada. Since then, Anderson’s Iris observations have become a classic dataset in statistics, machine learning, and data science teaching materials. It is included in the base R datasets package as iris, making it easy for users to access without knowing much about it. However, the lack of data documentation, presence of non-intuitive variables (e.g. “sepal width”), and perfectly balanced groups with zero missing values make iris an inadequate and stale dataset for teaching and learning modern data science skills. Users would benefit from working with a more representative, real-world environmental dataset with a clear link to current scientific research. Importantly, Anderson’s Iris data appeared in a 1936 publication by R. A. Fisher in the Annals of Eugenics (which is often the first-listed citation for the dataset), inextricably linking iris to eugenics research. Thus, a modern alternative to iris is needed. In this paper, we introduce the palmerpenguins R package (Horst et al., 2020), which includes body size measurements collected from 2007 - 2009 for three species of Pygoscelis penguins that breed on islands throughout the Palmer Archipelago, Antarctica. The penguins dataset in palmerpenguins provides an approachable, charismatic, and near drop-in replacement for iris with topical relevance for polar climate change and environmental impacts on marine predators. Since the release on CRAN in July 2020, the palmerpenguins package has been downloaded over 462,000 times, highlighting the demand and widespread adoption of this viable iris alternative. We directly compare the iris and penguins datasets for selected analyses to demonstrate that R users, in particular teachers and learners currently using iris, can switch to the Palmer Archipelago penguins for many use cases including data wrangling, visualization, linear modeling, multivariate analysis (e.g., PCA), cluster analysis and classification (e.g., by k-means).},

	abstract = {Rising temperatures due to climate change are predicted to threaten the persistence of wild animals, but there is little evidence that climate change has pushed species beyond their thermal tolerance. The immune system is an ideal avenue to assess the effects of climate change because immune performance is sensitive to changes in temperature and immune competency can affect reproductive success. We investigate the effect of rising temperatures on a biomarker of nonspecific immune performance in a wild population of capuchin monkeys and provide compelling evidence that immune performance is associated with ambient temperature. Critically, we found that immune performance in young individuals is more sensitive to high temperatures compared to other age groups. Coupled with evidence of rising temperatures in the region, our results offer insight into how climate change will affect the immune system of wild mammals.
