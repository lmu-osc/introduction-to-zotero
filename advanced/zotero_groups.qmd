# Zotero Groups Considerations

Zotero Groups are a great way to collaborate with others on a research project. However, there are some considerations to keep in mind when using Zotero Groups:

- **Privacy**: Zotero Groups are public by default, so be sure to set your group to private if you want to keep your references private.
- **Storage**: Zotero Groups have limited storage space, so be mindful of how many references you add to your group. This will really only be a concern if you wish to include PDF files with your references.
    - You can use up to 300MB for free. If you need more space, you can upgrade to a paid plan which are available in 2GB, 6GB, and Unlimited sizes for \$20, \$60, and \$120 per year, respectively.
- **Collaboration**: Zotero Groups allow for collaboration, but be sure to communicate with your collaborators about who can add, edit, and delete references.


# **Comprehensive Guide to Zotero Groups**

Zotero Groups provide an excellent platform for collaborative research,
enabling users to share, organize, and manage references and resources

## **Purpose of Zotero Groups**

Zotero Groups are designed to facilitate collaboration for:

-   Students working on group projects

![](../assets/groups-media/image8.png){width="6.267716535433071in" height="2.875in"}

Here you can customize your group by:

-   Sending member invitations

-   Transferring group ownership to another member if needed

There are three roles in Zotero Groups:

1.  **Regular Members**: Can read and edit the library (based on
    permissions)

2.  **Administrators**: Can manage group settings, invite members, and
    adjust permissions

3.  **Group Owners**: Have full administrative rights, including the
    ability to delete the group or transfer ownership

#### 4.3 Library Settings

![](../assets/groups-media/image9.png){width="6.267716535433071in"
height="3.2083333333333335in"}

Here you can customize your group by changing the following:

-   **Group Type:** Private, Public/Closed, Public/Opened

-   **Library Reading**: Control who can view items in the library

-   **Library Editing**: Set permissions for adding, editing, and
    organizing items

-   **File Editing**: Enable or restrict file sharing among group
    members

## **Interacting with Groups in Zotero Client**

-   Group libraries appear under \"Group Libraries\" in the Zotero
    desktop application.

-   Sync regularly to ensure updates are shared with all members.

-   Add, edit, and organize items directly within the desktop app.

## **Best Practices for Zotero Groups**

### **1. Structuring the Library**

#### **Inbox for New Items**

-   Create a temporary space or tag for unprocessed materials before
    adding them to the group library:

    -   In the Zotero desktop app, create a new collection (right-click
        on your personal library and select "New Collection").

    -   Name this collection something like "Inbox" or "To Process."

    -   When saving items to Zotero, apply a tag such as
        \"Unprocessed.\" You can do this directly when saving an item in
        your browser or later in the Zotero desktop app.

    -   Filter by this tag later to review and process these items.

#### **Workflow Notes**

-   Add a standalone note describing group workflows, including tag
    usage, folder structure, and \"related\" item definitions:

    -   In your group library, select \"New Note\" \> \"Standalone
        Note\" in the toolbar.

    -   Write a clear description of the group workflow, including
        folder usage, tagging conventions, and definitions for
        \"related\" items.

![](../assets/groups-media/image10.png){width="6.267716535433071in"
height="3.2083333333333335in"}

#### **Folder-Specific Notes**

-   In each subfolder (collection), create a standalone note explaining
    its purpose.

-   Keep these notes updated to reflect changes in folder usage.

### **2. Managing Tags**

#### **Tag Definitions**

-   Add a new standalone note in the group library.

-   List all tags used by the group and provide a brief explanation of
    their purpose.

-   Update the note whenever a new tag is added and communicate changes
    to group members.

height="3.1944444444444446in"}

#### **Tag Management**

-   Avoid adding too many tags by discussing with group members before
    creating new ones.

-   Regularly review and delete unused or redundant tags.

-   Open the \"Tags\" tab in the right-hand pane of Zotero, where you
    can add, edit, or delete tags directly.

### **3. Adding and Organizing Resources**

#### **Using the Zotero Browser Extension**

-   Save items directly to the group library by selecting the desired
    library from the drop-down menu in the browser extension.

#### **Dragging Items**

-   Drag and drop items from your personal library into the group
    library.

#### **Organizing Items**

-   Use tags and sub-collections to categorize and structure resources
    effectively.
