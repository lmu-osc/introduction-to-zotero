# Zotero Group Features

Before creating a group, it is important to reflect on which type of group you want, what the primary purpose of the group is and how you want others to interact within the sources shared within the group. 

## Group Types

The group type defines the characteristics of accessing the group and sharing materials and depends on the intended purpose of the group. 

  -----------------------------------------------------------------------
  **Group Type**    **Access**        **File Sharing**  **Best For**
  ----------------- ----------------- ----------------- -----------------
  Public, Open      Anyone can join   Not allowed       Sharing resources
  Membership        and access                          publicly

  Public, Closed    Visible to all,   Allowed for       Showcasing work
  Membership        members by invite members           selectively

  Private           Only invited      Allowed for       Private or
  Membership        members can       members           sensitive
                    access                              projects
  -----------------------------------------------------------------------

## Member Roles
Members within a Zotero group can be assigned one of three roles to determine how they interact with the shared materials:

1.  **Regular Members**: Can read and edit the library (based on
    permissions)

2.  **Administrators**: Can manage group settings, invite members, and
    adjust permissions

3.  **Group Owners**: Have full administrative rights, including the
    ability to delete the group or transfer ownership


## Group Library settings

Important group parameters are the following: 

-   **Group Type:** Private, Public/Closed, Public/Opened

-   **Library Reading**: Control who can view items in the library

-   **Library Editing**: Set permissions for adding, editing, and
    organizing items

-   **File Editing**: Enable or restrict file sharing among group
    members

## Interacting with Groups in Zotero Application

Group libraries appear under \"Group Libraries\" in the Zotero desktop application. Similar to your other colllections, you can add, edit and organise your sources for your group directly within the desktop application. It is important to sync regularly to ensure updates are shared with all collaborating members.

## Considerations for Zotero Groups

Zotero Groups are a great way to collaborate with others on a research project and to share sources. However, there are some considerations to keep in mind when using Zotero Groups:

- **Privacy**: Zotero Groups are public by default, so be sure to set your group to private if you want to keep your references private.
- **Storage**: Zotero Groups have limited storage space, so be mindful of how many references you add to your group. This will really only be a concern if you wish to include PDF files with your references. You can use up to 300MB for free. If you need more space, you can upgrade to a paid plan which are available in 2GB, 6GB, and Unlimited sizes for \$20, \$60, and \$120 per year, respectively.
- **Collaboration**: Zotero Groups allow for collaboration, but be sure to communicate with your collaborators about who can add, edit, and delete references.
