-   Note that the instructions here rely on the use of RStudio. If you are not using RStudio, you should note that whatever text editor you are using may not have the same functionality as RStudio, and you may need to adjust your workflow accordingly. That said, these instructions also cover text-only editing options that should be viable approaches to editing your document to include citations and a bibliography via any text editor.

-   Advantage of using RStudio for this process: it will automatically generate a bibilography file for you when inserting a citation, it will add the bibliography to the yaml of your file, the bibliography file will be automatically updated to include any new citations you add, and it will automatically generate the bibliography in the format you specify in the yaml of your file.

-   For other text editors, you must first generate your bibliography file, and then manually add the bibliography to the yaml of your file. You will also need to manually update the bibliography file to include any new citations you add.

-   If you are using another text editor, you can check out the [Tutorial: Authoring](https://quarto.org/docs/get-started/authoring/text-editor.html#citations) Quarto documentation page for more information.

# Inserting Citations

To insert a citation in your document, you will need to use the `@` symbol followed by the citation key of the reference you want to cite. The citation key is a unique identifier for each reference in your Zotero library. You can find the citation key for a reference by opening Zotero, right-clicking on the reference, and selecting "Copy Citation Key".

For example, to cite the Zotero Quick Start guide, you would use the following syntax:

``` markdown
"Items can be assigned tags. Tags are named by the user. An item can be assigned as many tags as is needed."[@zotero]
```

This will insert a citation in your document that looks like this: "Items can be assigned tags. Tags are named by the user. An item can be assigned as many tags as is needed."[@zotero].

## Citation Keys

-   Uses Pandoc citation syntax.
-   The citation key is the unique identifier for each reference in your Zotero library.
-   

You may be asking how the Zotero Quick Start Guide document received the tag "zotero".

This is a tag that can be assigned to the document in Zotero. You can assign tags to your documents in Zotero by right-clicking on the document and selecting "Add Tag".

## Inserting Citations in RStudio

### RStudio Visual Editor

### Manual Entry

This will insert a citation in your document that looks like this: \[\@zotero\].

The first time you insert a citation, a `references.bib` file should be generated in the same directory as your document. This file will contain the citation information for the references you have cited in your document.

# Adding a Bibliography

## Adding to YAML

To add a bibliography to your document, you will need to include a YAML metadata block at the beginning of your document that specifies the citation style you want to use. You can find a list of supported citation styles [here](https://citationstyles.org/).

For example, to add a bibliography in APA style, you would include the following YAML metadata block at the beginning of your document:

``` yaml
---
title: "My Document"
bibliography: references.bib
---
```

This will generate a bibliography at the end of your document that includes all of the references you have cited in your document.

## Adding References at the End of the Document

# Changing Citation Style

Here is an example of a document that includes citations and a bibliography:

``` yaml
---
title: "My Document"
bibliography: references.bib
csl: your-csl-file.csl
---
```
